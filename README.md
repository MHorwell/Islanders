The puzzle is as follows:

You have twelve people on an island.
All of them are of identical weight except one who is either lighter or heavier.
You must determine which islander is the outlier and if they are heavier or lighter.
You can only determine weights by using a seesaw.
You can only use the seesaw a maximum of three times.

This project is just a quick proof to ensure that the solution works by iterating through all possible scenarios.
